# Set the maximum number of completion candidates.
#
# GDB will stop looking for more completions once it collects this many
# candidates. This is useful when completing on things like function names as
# collecting all the possible candidates can be time consuming.
#
# The default value is 200. A value of zero disables tab-completion.
#
# Note that setting either no limit or a very large limit can make completion
# slow.
